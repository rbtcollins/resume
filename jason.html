<H2>NAME</H2>

jason tevnan - cloud and database-wrangler with a penchant for automation and sous vide cooking
<A NAME="lbAC"> </A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

jason [--store SQL|NOSQL] [--administrate] [--automate] 
[--monitor] [--virtualize] [--lead] [--think]
<A NAME="lbAD"></A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

I have been around and seen some stuff, but am the first to admit it when i am out of my league. I pursue issues with a passion (as any good DBA would) and don't settle for it just works. I love learning new technologies and wrapping my head around new paradigms, ideally while enjoying dark-roast coffee at my standing desk.
<A NAME="lbAE"></A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>--store=</B><I>SQL</I>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>MySQL</B>

is my true love. 
<BR> - Verifying database workloads, identifying slow queries, tuning innodb settings, while providing an HA database can be alot of fun
<BR> - Scaled Runtastic's core database starting at 1M users to 99M users and the ability to handle 100k QPS
<BR> - Partitioning a table or verifying the innodb engine status, I love it
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Oracle </B>

is where i cut my teeth on. 
<BR> - Had to learn on highly performant, always on database systems
<BR> - Learned what a missing index can do, which queries to avoid and how to find the meaning of all those v$ views
<BR> - The experience I gathered understanding B-Tree index look-ups, helped me to understand look-ups across all database systems
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>PostgreSQL</B>

is interesting
<BR> - Used it with all its geo-spatial features for OpenStreetMap
<BR> - Automated replicating to another database with slony before 9.0 came out with log shipping
<BR> - Housekeeping functions took some getting used to
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>--store=</B><I>NOSQL</I>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>MongoDB</B>

is a challenge to wrap my head around. Schema-less?! 
<BR> - Attended admin training courses to understand: schema-less can also be a curse since it is incredibly challenging when defining a scalable, future proof indexing concept
<BR> - Enjoy shard key definitions for collections to ensure the fewest scatter-gather queries, Optimizing storage read ahead settings and playing with Wiredtiger cache options
<BR> - Have lots of experience running the robust HA setup which is very easy to run from an operations standpoint
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Cassandra</B>

forgives a lot.
<BR> - I find the replication approach and ring setup amazingly robust with anisotropic read repairs and the ability to stream and receive data while accepting queries
<BR> - Scaled our cluster from 4 to 8 to 32 and finally to 64 nodes with almost no downtime 
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Redis</B>

and Redis cluster are my nemesis. 
<BR> - Run instances under normal conditions as well as high load condition
<BR> - Have found the right balance between ram and IOs to ensure that they can flush to disk
<BR> - Since Redis is the core of many ruby queueing solutions, I have been forced to face my fears, tuning BGSAVE cycles and finding the optimal fsync to AOF ratios
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>--administrate</B>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>LAMP</B>

<BR> - traditional stack (e.g. apache2, nginx) 
<BR> - extended web servers (e.g. trinidad, passenger)
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Loadbalancers</B>

<BR> - Experience debugging performance bottlenecks
<BR> - Setup instances which handle &gt; 80k rpm
<BR> - HaProxy, nginx
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Golden Oldies</B>

<BR> - LOTS of experience with the normal Linux stack (e.g. bind, dhcpd, ldap, openvpn, ssh, memcached ...)
<BR> - After &gt; 15 years experience with all aspects of the os, i still think Linux is the best for servers
</DL>

<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Distributed fun</B>

<BR> - zookeeper
<BR> - rabbitmq
<BR> - activemq
<BR> - all in clusters running at least 3 nodes
<BR> - very interesting (i.E. challenging) to scale
</DL>

<P>
<DT><B>--automate</B>

<DD>
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<B>Chef </B>

<BR> - Apart from coffee, my greatest passion is automation
<BR> - Try to ensure that all infrastructure code has full test coverage
<BR> - Test-Kitchen is my friend
<BR> - While Chef is not the answer to world hunger, an automation tool with its feature set especially regarding testing and auditing is inevitable in today's world of highly fluctuant infrastructure.
