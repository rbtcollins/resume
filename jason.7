[\-\-monitor] [\-\-virtualize] [\-\-lead] [\-\-think]
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
I have been around and seen some stuff, but am the first to admit it
when i am out of my league.
I pursue issues with a passion (as any good DBA would) and don't settle
for it just works.
I love learning new technologies and wrapping my head around new
paradigms, ideally while enjoying dark\-roast coffee at my standing
desk.
.SS OPTIONS
.SS \-\-store=\f[I]SQL\f[]
.SS MySQL is my true love.
.IP \[bu] 2
Verifying database workloads, identifying slow queries, tuning innodb
settings, while providing an HA database can be a lot of fun
.IP \[bu] 2
Scaled Runtastic's core database starting at 1M users to 99M users and
the ability to handle 100k QPS
.IP \[bu] 2
Partitioning a table or verifying the innodb engine status, I love it
.SS Oracle is where i cut my teeth on.
.IP \[bu] 2
Had to learn on highly performant, always\-on database systems
.IP \[bu] 2
Learned what a missing index can do, which queries to avoid and how to
find the meaning of all those v$ views
.IP \[bu] 2
The experience I gathered understanding B\-Tree index look\-ups, helped
me to understand look\-ups across all database systems
.SS PostgreSQL is interesting
.IP \[bu] 2
Used it with all its geo\-spatial features for OpenStreetMap
.IP \[bu] 2
Automated replicating to another database with slony before 9.0 came out
with log shipping
.IP \[bu] 2
Automated replication and fail\-over with repmgrd
.IP \[bu] 2
Had lots of fun automating pgbouncer with consul as a HA write endpoint
.IP \[bu] 2
Housekeeping functions took some getting used to
.SS \-\-store=\f[I]NOSQL\f[]
.SS MongoDB is a challenge to wrap my head around. Schema\-less?!
.IP \[bu] 2
Attended admin training courses to understand: schema\-less can also be
a curse since it is incredibly challenging when defining a scalable,
future proof indexing concept
.IP \[bu] 2
Enjoy shard key definitions for collections to ensure the fewest
scatter\-gather queries, Optimizing storage read ahead settings and
playing with Wiredtiger cache options
.IP \[bu] 2
Have lots of experience running the robust HA setup which is very easy
to run from an operations standpoint
.SS Cassandra forgives a lot.
.IP \[bu] 2
I find the replication approach and ring setup amazingly robust with
anisotropic read repairs and the ability to stream and receive data
while accepting queries
.IP \[bu] 2
Scaled Runtastic's cluster from 4 to 8 to 32 and finally to 64 nodes
with almost no downtime
.SS Redis and Redis cluster are my nemesis.
.IP \[bu] 2
Run instances under normal conditions as well as high load condition
.PD 0
.P
.PD
.IP \[bu] 2
Have found the right balance between ram and IOs to ensure that they can
flush to disk
.IP \[bu] 2
Since Redis is the core of many ruby queueing solutions, I have been
forced to face my fears, tuning BGSAVE cycles and finding the optimal
fsync to AOF ratios
.SS \-\-administrate
.SS LAMP
.IP \[bu] 2
Traditional stack (e.g.
apache2, nginx)
.IP \[bu] 2
Extended web servers (e.g.
trinidad, passenger)
.SS Loadbalancers
.IP \[bu] 2
Experience debugging performance bottlenecks
.IP \[bu] 2
Setup instances which handle > 80k rpm
.IP \[bu] 2
HaProxy, nginx
.SS Golden Oldies
.IP \[bu] 2
LOTS of experience with the normal Linux stack (e.g.
bind, dhcpd, ldap, openvpn, ssh, memcached ...)
.IP \[bu] 2
After > 15 years experience with all aspects of the os, i still think
Linux is the best for servers
.SS Distributed fun
.IP \[bu] 2
zookeeper
.IP \[bu] 2
rabbitmq
.IP \[bu] 2
activemq
.IP \[bu] 2
consul (for service discovery)
.IP \[bu] 2
All in clusters running at least 3 nodes
.IP \[bu] 2
Very interesting (i.E.
challenging) to scale
.SS \-\-automate
.SS Chef
.IP \[bu] 2
Apart from coffee, my greatest passion is automation
.IP \[bu] 2
Try to ensure that all infrastructure code has full test coverage
.IP \[bu] 2
Test\-Kitchen, inspec and chefspec are my friends
.IP \[bu] 2
While Chef is not the answer to world hunger, an automation tool with
its feature set especially regarding testing and auditing is inevitable
in today's world of highly fluctuant infrastructure.
.SS \-\-monitor
.SS Nagios3
.IP \[bu] 2
Wrote and deployed numerous checks
.IP \[bu] 2
Running an nrpe based deployment with full automation

.SS Prometheus
.IP \[bu] 2
Alert\-manager, recording\-rule, exporter \- oh my.
Very powerful solution with an ever growing community.

Experience with some storage engine and memory shenanigans
.IP \[bu] 2

API) and as a simple server manager
.IP \[bu] 2
In the process of automating setup and configuration via teraform
